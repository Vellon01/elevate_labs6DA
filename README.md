# Sales Trend Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sales data to identify trends in revenue and order volume using SQL and Python. The insights derived can help business stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Project Structure

- `task6.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis, SQL queries, data transformations, and visualizations.
- `sales_data.db` - SQLite database containing raw sales data used for querying.
- `sales_data_sample.csv` - Sample sales data in CSV format for initial exploration or import.

## Features

- Monthly sales revenue aggregation
- Order volume tracking
- Trend visualization using line plots and bar charts
- SQL-powered data extraction using SQLite
- Insights summary for business decision-making

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, sqlite3)
- SQLite (for querying data from `sales_data.db`)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV for raw data

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `task6.ipynb` notebook.
3. Make sure all files (`sales_data.db`, `sales_data_sample.csv`) are in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Run the notebook step-by-step to see:
   - Data loading and exploration
   - SQL queries to fetch monthly sales and order data
   - Data visualizations

## Insights Covered

- Monthly Revenue Trends
- Monthly Order Volumes
- High and low performing months
- Potential seasonality or spikes in sales

## Note

- This project is part of a data analyst task focused on sales trend analysis.
- You can extend it by integrating it with dashboards in Tableau or Power BI for interactive reports.
